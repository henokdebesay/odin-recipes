        </li>
        <li>1 tomato
        </li>
        <li>1/2 cup oil
        </li>
        <li>1/2 cup shiro powder (chickpea or broad bean powder)
        </li>

    </ul>

<p>Instructions</p>
<ol>
    <li>Purée or mash the fresh ginger and garlic into a paste.</li>
    <li>In a bowl, mix together the steak, onion, rosemary, ginger, garlic, berebere and salt. Place a pan on medium heat. Add the oil and butter. When the pan is hot, place the spiced meat and onion mixture into the hot pan and cook for about 5 minutes.
        <br>
        PRO TIP: Do not stir the meat right away. Let it sit in the hot pan for the first couple of minutes to brown on the bottom. Also, make sure you use a wide-enough pan so the meat does not steam. Steaming also prevents browning.</li>
    <li>Add ½ cup water and cook for another 5 minutes. Taste for seasoning. Add fresh chopped tomatoes if desired. Serve with rice, or with injera (which can be purchased from a local Ethiopian market). </li>
</ol>
